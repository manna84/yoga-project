                    <p>Yoga is an ancient system from India. This system includes asanas (postures) that help you to become healthier, balanced and can create the opportunity to enter deep states of meditation. The yogic system helps you become flexible, release tension, and burn toxins so that you can experience peace, calmness, relaxation, and clarity.</p>

                    <p>“Purnam” in Sanskrit means perfection. With a blend of intensive breathing techniques and yoga postures, Acharya Shree Yogeesh developed the Purnam System, which helps cleanse your body of toxins and negativities and immediately brings clarity, a sense of lightness, reduced tension and the ability to meditate deeply. This is a new and unique system not taught elsewhere. </p>

                    <h2>Benefits of yoga</h2>
                    <p>Exercise boosts energy and mood, and yoga is no exception. Many who practice it do so for its benefits in terms of relaxation and stress management. And studies have shown yoga interventions are linked to improved objective measures of stress levels in the body, like reduced evening cortisol levels, reduced waking cortisol levels, and lower resting heart rate, according to a review published in 2017 the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.</p>

                    <p>Yoga uses controlled breathing as a way to merge the mind, body, and spirit. The breathing techniques are called pranayamas; prana means energy or life force, and yama means social ethics. It is believed that the controlled breathing of pranayamas will control the energy flow in your body. It is my experience that controlled breathing helps me focus on muscles that are working, and during savasana, it slows down my heart rate, calms my mind, and leads to a deep, inner calm and sense of relaxation.</p>

                    <p>Yoga seems to be at least as effective as other types of exercise in relieving menopause symptoms. A 2018 evaluation of 13 studies (more than 1,300 participants) of yoga for menopause symptoms found that yoga reduced physical symptoms, such as hot flashes, as well as psychological symptoms.</p>
                    <p>There’s promising evidence that yoga may help people with some chronic diseases manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Thus, it could be a helpful addition to treatment programs.</p>

                    <h3>Yin Yoga</h3>
                     <p>If you are not into too much hectic activity, then Yin yoga is just the practice for you. This slow-paced style lets you hold poses for a longer time—from 45 seconds to two minutes. There are also a lot of seated postures and a focus on spirituality, inner peace and relaxation. By holding poses for a longer time, you stretch your connective tissue and make it more elastic. You also improve blood circulation and the qi energy in your body. Props help you relax into the postures instead of keeping your muscles flexed and taut. This style is often practiced in a heated room to help your muscles become more elastic. You must not try this if you are super flexible (as you can get injuries if you over-stretch) or have any connective tissue disease.</p>

                    <h3>Restorative Yoga</h3>
                     <p>If you are in stressful job, this is just the yoga practice for you. As the name suggests, restorative yoga postures are meant to relax and rejuvenate. Many of the classic yoga poses have been modified so that they are easier to do and are more relaxing. This practice helps you tap your parasympathetic nervous system so that you can truly relax your mind and body deeply. Like Iyengar yoga this style too takes the help of props like blankets, bolsters and yoga blocks to help you perfect each yoga pose without straining yourself too much. If you are struggling with insomnia, anxiety, stress-related illnesses, then you should definitely try restorative yoga.</p>

                    <h3>Anusara Yoga</h3>
                     <p>In this version of Hatha yoga, Anusara yoga has postures that are used in a Vinyasa practice and here too there is a lot of focus on alignment. However, in Anusara the mind-body-heart connection is key and you will be encouraged to uplift yourself, find inner peace and the “light within yourself.” This style uses props to help you reach the perfect pose.</p>
