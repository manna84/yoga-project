                    <p>Yoga is an ancient system from India. This system includes asanas (postures) that help you to become healthier, balanced and can create the opportunity to enter deep states of meditation. The yogic system helps you become flexible, release tension, and burn toxins so that you can experience peace, calmness, relaxation, and clarity.</p>

                    <p>“Purnam” in Sanskrit means perfection. With a blend of intensive breathing techniques and yoga postures, Acharya Shree Yogeesh developed the Purnam System, which helps cleanse your body of toxins and negativities and immediately brings clarity, a sense of lightness, reduced tension and the ability to meditate deeply. This is a new and unique system not taught elsewhere. </p>

                    <p>Yoga is amazing—even if you only practice for one hour a week, you will experience the benefits of the practice. If you can do more than that, you will certainly experience more benefits. </p>

                    <h2>Benefits of yoga</h2>
                    <p>Exercise boosts energy and mood, and yoga is no exception. Many who practice it do so for its benefits in terms of relaxation and stress management. And studies have shown yoga interventions are linked to improved objective measures of stress levels in the body, like reduced evening cortisol levels, reduced waking cortisol levels, and lower resting heart rate, according to a review published in 2017 the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.</p>

                    <p>Yoga uses controlled breathing as a way to merge the mind, body, and spirit. The breathing techniques are called pranayamas; prana means energy or life force, and yama means social ethics. It is believed that the controlled breathing of pranayamas will control the energy flow in your body. It is my experience that controlled breathing helps me focus on muscles that are working, and during savasana, it slows down my heart rate, calms my mind, and leads to a deep, inner calm and sense of relaxation.</p>

                    <p>Yoga seems to be at least as effective as other types of exercise in relieving menopause symptoms. A 2018 evaluation of 13 studies (more than 1,300 participants) of yoga for menopause symptoms found that yoga reduced physical symptoms, such as hot flashes, as well as psychological symptoms.</p>
                    <p>There’s promising evidence that yoga may help people with some chronic diseases manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Thus, it could be a helpful addition to treatment programs.</p>
